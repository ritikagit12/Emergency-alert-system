# Emergency Alert System

## Overview

This Emergency Alert System is a software developed using C++. It is designed to handle emergency situations by allowing users to input their information and current location, select an emergency type, and dispatch emergency services accordingly.

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **User Information Management**: In this part, user information is stored in a text file using file handling techniques. Users provide their details which are permanently stored in a txt file.
2. **Emergency Alert Handling**: This part involves accessing the stored user information, displaying it for selection, prompting the user to input their current location, and choosing from a list of emergency situations. Based on the chosen emergency, appropriate services are dispatched to the user's current location.
